# Part 6: Implementing Constrained Decoding for Phi-3-Vision

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll look at constrained decoding, a method for guiding the text generation of our Phi-3-Vision model. This technique can be useful in various applications, from generating structured text to answering specific types of questions.

## Understanding Constrained Decoding

Constrained decoding is a way to generate text that includes certain phrases or follows a specific structure. It works by setting "constraints" - phrases that the model must include in its output within a certain number of tokens. This approach can be helpful for tasks such as:

- Generating code with specific elements
- Creating responses that follow a particular format (e.g., JSON)
- Producing step-by-step reasoning for problem-solving
- Answering multiple-choice questions in a structured way

By using constrained decoding, we can guide the model's output without changing its underlying knowledge or capabilities. It's simply a way to shape how the model expresses its information.

## Implementing Constrained Decoding

Now that we understand the concept, let's look at how we can implement constrained decoding. The following pseudocode demonstrates one way to approach this task. It takes a model, a processor (for tokenization), a prompt, and a list of constraints as inputs.

```python
def constrain(model, processor, prompt, constraints):
    input_ids = process(prompt)
    for each constraint in constraints:
        max_tokens, constraint_text = constraint
        constraint_ids = tokenize(constraint_text)
        
        best_sequence = input_ids
        best_score = -infinity
        
        for token_count = 1 to max_tokens:
            candidate_sequences = generate_candidates(best_sequence)
            for each candidate in candidate_sequences:
                full_sequence = concatenate(candidate, constraint_ids)
                score = calculate_sequence_score(full_sequence)
                
                if score > best_score:
                    best_score = score
                    best_sequence = candidate
            
            if best_sequence ends with constraint_ids:
                break
        
        input_ids = concatenate(best_sequence, constraint_ids)
    
    return decode(input_ids)
```

Let's break down how this function works:

1. We start with the initial prompt.
2. For each constraint:

   - We generate candidate sequences up to the max token limit.
   - For each candidate, we calculate the score of the candidate plus the constraint.
   - We keep track of the best-scoring sequence.
   - If the best sequence naturally ends with the constraint, we stop early.
   - Otherwise, we force-append the constraint after reaching max tokens.
   
3. We return the final generated text.

This implementation allows for flexibility in how we apply constraints. It tries to generate text that naturally includes the constraints, but if it can't do so within the token limit, it ensures the constraints are still included.

It's worth noting that this is a simplified version of the algorithm. In practice, you might need to adjust this based on your specific model architecture and requirements. For example, you might want to implement beam search or adjust how scores are calculated for better results.

## Using Constrained Decoding

Here's an example of how to use our constrained decoding function:

```python
from phi_3_vision_mlx import constrain

constrain(
    prompt="Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.", 
    constr=[
        (100, "\n```python\n"), 
        (100, " return "), 
        (200, "\n```")
    ], 
    use_beam=True
)
```

In this example, we're instructing the model to generate a Python function for calculating the Fibonacci sequence. The constraints ensure that the output is formatted as a code block and includes a return statement. This approach helps structure the generated code in a clear and readable format.

The function can also guide the model to provide reasoning before concluding with an answer:

```python
prompts = [
    "A 20-year-old woman presents with menorrhagia for the past several years. She says that her menses “have always been heavy”, and she has experienced easy bruising for as long as she can remember. Family history is significant for her mother, who had similar problems with bruising easily. The patient's vital signs include: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F), and blood pressure 110/87 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show the following: platelet count 200,000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, and PTT 43 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms? A: Factor V Leiden B: Hemophilia A C: Lupus anticoagulant D: Protein C deficiency E: Von Willebrand disease",
    "A 25-year-old primigravida presents to her physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is at 34 weeks gestation, as confirmed by an ultrasound examination. She has no complaints, but notes that the new shoes she bought 2 weeks ago do not fit anymore. The course of her pregnancy has been uneventful and she has been compliant with the recommended prenatal care. Her medical history is unremarkable. She has a 15-pound weight gain since the last visit 3 weeks ago. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 148/90 mm Hg; heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The blood pressure on repeat assessment 4 hours later is 151/90 mm Hg. The fetal heart rate is 151/min. The physical examination is significant for 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremity. Which of the following tests o should confirm the probable condition of this patient? A: Bilirubin assessment B: Coagulation studies C: Hematocrit assessment D: Leukocyte count with differential E: 24-hour urine protein"
]

constraints=[(30, ' The correct answer is'), (10, 'X.')]
results = constrain(prompts, constraints, use_beam=True)
```

The constraints encourage a structured response that includes the thought process, making the output more informative and transparent. This structured approach helps us understand how the model arrived at its answer, rather than just seeing the final choice. It's like asking a student to show their work in a math problem – we get to see the reasoning behind the result.

## Conclusion

Constrained decoding allows for more controlled text generation with Phi-3-Vision. It ensures the output includes specific phrases or follows a certain structure, which is useful for tasks requiring specific output formats or content.

In the next part of our series, we'll explore techniques for fine-tuning our model on custom datasets, allowing us to adapt Phi-3-Vision for specific tasks or domains.
